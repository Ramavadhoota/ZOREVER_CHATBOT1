"Let me start by showing you the project structure. This is a well-organized, production-ready application with clear separation of concerns. The root directory contains configuration files, documentation, and the main application structure. Each file serves a specific purpose in making this chatbot robust, secure, and easy to deploy."
```

### **üìÑ requirements.txt - Dependency Management (45 seconds)**
```
"This requirements.txt file is crucial for project deployment and collaboration. It specifies exact versions of all Python packages needed to run the application. 

We have Streamlit version 1.28.0 for creating the web interface - it's perfect for rapid prototyping and provides a modern, responsive UI. Pandas 2.0.3 handles all our data operations, from reading CSV files to processing user interactions. The Groq library version 0.4.1 integrates with Groq's AI API for intelligent responses, and python-dotenv 1.0.0 manages our environment variables securely.

This version pinning ensures that anyone who clones the repository will have exactly the same environment, preventing compatibility issues and making the project truly portable."
```

### **üìÑ README.md - Comprehensive Documentation (45 seconds)**
```
"The README.md file is more than just documentation - it's a complete project guide. I've structured it to serve multiple audiences: developers who want to understand the code, business stakeholders who need to understand the value proposition, and end users who want to know how to use the system.

It includes detailed installation instructions with step-by-step commands, comprehensive usage examples showing real user interactions, troubleshooting guides for common issues, and business benefits analysis. The documentation also explains the data collection features, security measures, and customization options for different real estate businesses.

This level of documentation is essential for any production application, ensuring maintainability and ease of deployment."
```

### **üìÑ .env - Security Configuration (30 seconds)**
```
"The .env file demonstrates proper security practices in application development. It stores sensitive configuration like API keys outside of the source code. This is crucial because API keys should never be committed to version control - they could be exposed publicly and lead to security breaches or unexpected charges.

The file contains the GROQ_API_KEY variable, which is loaded securely by the python-dotenv library. Users need to create their own .env file with their actual API credentials. This approach follows security best practices and makes the application configurable for different environments."
```

### **üìÑ .gitignore - Repository Security (30 seconds)**
```
"The .gitignore file is essential for maintaining a clean and secure repository. It prevents sensitive files like .env from being accidentally committed. It also excludes Python cache files, virtual environment directories, and IDE-specific files that shouldn't be in version control.

This ensures that only the necessary source code and documentation are tracked, while keeping the repository size manageable and preventing security vulnerabilities. It's a small file but critical for professional project management."
```

```
"Now let's look at the data layer. The properties.csv file contains our comprehensive property database with 12 real estate listings across multiple cities including Dubai, Mumbai, Bangalore, and others. Each property record includes detailed information: a unique listing ID like P001, P002, etc., property name, complete address, city, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price in USD, property type, availability status, and agent contact information.

This structured data enables the chatbot to provide accurate, detailed responses to property inquiries. The data is realistic and diverse, covering different property types from studios to villas, various price ranges, and different availability statuses. This diversity allows us to test and demonstrate the chatbot's ability to handle various real-world scenarios.

The data structure is designed to be easily extensible - new properties can be added by simply appending rows to this CSV file, making the system scalable for larger real estate portfolios."
```

### **üìä data/visits.csv - Interaction Analytics (1 minute)**
```
"The visits.csv file is where the real business value comes in. This file automatically captures every user interaction with the chatbot, creating a comprehensive audit trail and analytics database. Each row represents a user interaction with timestamps, user identification from the login system, the exact query they asked, the bot's response, and any relevant property information.

This data collection is invaluable for business intelligence. We can analyze which properties generate the most interest, understand common user questions, track booking conversion rates, and identify patterns in user behavior. The data includes user demographics from the login system, allowing for targeted marketing and personalized service.

The structure supports both operational needs - like tracking individual user sessions - and strategic analysis - like understanding market trends and property popularity. This transforms the chatbot from a simple customer service tool into a powerful business intelligence platform."

## üêç **Application Logic - Core Functionality**

### **üêç src/app.py - Main Application (1.5 minutes)**
```
"The main application file, app.py, is the heart of the system. It orchestrates all the components to create a seamless user experience. Let me break down its key responsibilities:

First, it implements a secure login system using Streamlit's session state management. Users must provide their name, email, and phone number before accessing the chatbot. This ensures we can track all interactions and provide personalized service. The login form validates input and stores user information securely.

Second, it manages the chat interface using Streamlit's chat components. The system maintains conversation history, displays messages in a user-friendly format, and handles real-time user input. The chat interface is responsive and provides immediate feedback to users.

Third, it coordinates the intent detection system. When a user sends a message, the app determines whether it's a property query, booking request, or general FAQ. This routing ensures users get the most appropriate response and maintains conversation flow.

Fourth, it handles the booking workflow. When users want to schedule property visits, the app guides them through a structured process, collecting necessary information and saving it to the database. The booking flow is intuitive and captures all required details.

Finally, it implements comprehensive data logging. Every interaction is automatically saved with user context, timestamps, and response details. This creates a complete audit trail and enables business analytics."
```

### **üêç src/helpers.py - Business Logic (1.5 minutes)**
```
"The helpers.py file contains the core business logic separated into two main classes, following good software engineering practices. This separation of concerns makes the code maintainable, testable, and extensible.

The PropertyHelper class manages all property-related functionality. It loads the property database from CSV files using robust path resolution that works regardless of where the application is run from. It implements intelligent search algorithms that can find properties by listing ID or name, handling variations in user input.

The class also integrates with Groq AI for enhanced responses. When users ask about properties, the system can provide not just basic information but also intelligent insights and recommendations. This AI integration makes the chatbot more helpful and engaging than a simple database lookup.

The PropertyHelper also handles the booking system, saving visit requests with complete user and property information. It includes error handling and validation to ensure data integrity.

The FAQHelper class manages general knowledge about the company, office information, working hours, and contact details. It uses pattern matching to understand user questions and provide accurate, helpful responses. This reduces the workload on human agents and provides instant support to users.

Both classes are designed to be easily extensible - new properties can be added to the database, new FAQ categories can be implemented, and the AI integration can be enhanced with additional capabilities."
```
